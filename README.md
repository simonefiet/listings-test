# Unit Testing in PHP
 
In this project, I have added unit tests to an existing application to ensure that it is functioning as intended. The project I have tested is a directory of PHP Conferences. 

To see tests in action
1. Open terminal
2. Go to folder path
3. Run tests with 
```
vendor/bin/phpunit --testdox tests
```
